# Small assignment done
## Created a json file that links to my vite project.
- Creates a map that desctructures into a small listing of items
- These items are real and you can search them up (It is home/business security equipment)
- A little css to make it look visually pleasing
### Just fyi it is NOT responsive design. Just got the data on the screen.
